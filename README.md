# CS-340-Project-2
#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adpaptable, code must be explained through comments throughoout the program. The use of modules are also important so that code can be easily maintained and adpaptable.
The CRUD Python module can be used in other programs in the future by importing and calling the module in those programs.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, problems should be broken up into smaller chunks. Solving each problem chunck separately and then making sure that they work collectively is an effective way of solving larger problems.

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists help make sense of data by organizing it and allowing it to be presented in a way that people can understand it and get information from it. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, using the web application will allow them to see multiple points of data like lists, location based data, and graphical representations of the data by simply selecting what data they want to see instead of having to type commands directly in the database.
